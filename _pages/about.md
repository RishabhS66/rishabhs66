**Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rishabh Srivastava.**

Fresh out of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with an MS in Computer Science (Machine Learning track), I'm passionate about transforming cutting-edge research into real-world AI solutions.

I've built smart tech at [Rubicon Robotics](https://rubiconrobotics.com/), crafting computer vision algorithms that dive deepâ€”literallyâ€”into swimmer detection and posture analysis, while scaling backend infrastructure on the cloud. At [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/in/), I redefined digital asset search using AI-driven captioning and search optimization, even supercharging GenAI integrations with Adobe Firefly.

In the research realm, I built AI-CNet3D, a cross-attention 3D CNN that dramatically improved glaucoma detection using OCT volumes at [AI4VS Lab](https://www.ai4vslab.org/). I also advanced Vision Transformers for Age-related Macular Degeneration detection, integrating attention-alignment with expert gaze patterns for enhanced interpretability. Meanwhile, at [ARISE Lab](https://www.rayb.info/ariselab) Lab, I fine-tuned SemCoder-S, a semantic-aware code LLM outperforming peers on execution prediction â€” pushing the boundaries of what AI can understand about code correctness.

I'm passionate about creating scalable, innovative AI solutions and am actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute my expertise in backend engineering, machine learning infrastructure, and AI-driven applications. Let's connect and build impactful technology together!
