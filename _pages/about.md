I am an incoming Master's student in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). My primary interests lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and recently, NLP.

I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics & Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/) in 2021. During my days at IITG, I strengthened my fundamentals for Machine Learning and took some other interesting courses on Game Theory and Quantum Computing.

In Summer '19, I got the chance to research at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/home) in the field of fuzzy clustering. The next summer, I combined research and industry by interning at [Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab](https://research.adobe.com/), where I explored Reinforcement Learning algorithms for Sequential Pattern Mining.

Before Columbia, I worked at [Adobe India](https://www.adobe.com/in/) in the [Adobe Experience Manager - Assets](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/overview.html) team. Here, I learned what being a Software Engineer means, and further cemented my understanding of how research is combined with industry demands to best cater to the customers' needs.

I love writing new code and am currently open to internship opportunities for Summer '24!
