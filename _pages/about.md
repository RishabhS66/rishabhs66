**Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rishabh Srivastava.**

Currently on a mission at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), where I'm deep-diving into the world of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP as a Master's student in Computer Science. You could say Iâ€™m a tech enthusiast with a relentless curiosity for all things AI.

My journey in tech has been nothing short of an adventure! Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/in/), where I got to play around with AI models and enhance digital asset management systems. Now, as a Software Engineer Intern at [Rubicon Robotics](https://rubiconrobotics.com/), Iâ€™m making wavesâ€”literallyâ€”by implementing computer vision algorithms for swimmer detection and posture analysis. You can also find me at Columbiaâ€™s [ARISE Lab](https://www.rayb.info/ariselab) sometimes, fine-tuning code LLMs to be smarter and more semantic-aware.

As I gear up to graduate in December 2024, Iâ€™m excited about the future and eager to take on full-time opportunities where I can bring my passion and skills to make a real impact.

Letâ€™s connect and create something amazing together!
